    <section class="mealworm-home">
        <h1>Mealworm <em>(Tenebrio molitor)</em></h1>
        <p>Economically, Tenebrio molitor larvae popularly known as mealworms, are 
            considered to be one of the most if not the primary species used for massive conversion of 
            biomass into protein.These tiny creatures are deemed to be the best option as reducing 
            meat-based diets will be beneficial for environmental, health and economic factors (Grau 
            et al., 2017).Moreover, the nutritional components of mealworms can be classified as 
            “high in” and “source of” based on the thresholds for World Health Organization and Food 
            and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations food labels. Mealworms have a high 
            protein and fat content apart from the large amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (Nowak 
            et al., 2016) and have a considerably higher nutritional content than beef and chicken, and 
            aren't greatly less nutritionally balanced, as compared to traditional meats (Payne et al., 
            2016).</p><br>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Mealworms are elongate and cylindrical, hard-bodied and yellow to golden brown
                    crop, flour, and vegetable organisms that are distributed all over the world. They are simple 
                    to breed, and their protein content remains constant regardless of their diet, implying that 
                    T. molitor larvae can be reliably produced.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mealworm-column">
                <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
                <p>T. molitor is a darkling beetle that has four life stages of development: egg, larva, 
                pupa, and adult. Female T. molitor specimens lay about 500 eggs, which hatch after 3-9 
                days and transition into larvae at 25 degree celsius. The larva period lasts 1-8 months, followed by a 
                pupal stage that ranges 5-28 days at 18 degree celsius and a 2-3 months adult stage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mealworm-column">
                <h3>Types</h3>
                <p>Tenebrio molitor L. which is commonly known as Yellow mealworm, Zophobas 
                    morio/atratus (giant mealworm/giant mealworm beetle), and Alphitobius diaperinus panzer 
                    (lesser mealworm) are the three species of mealworms. </p>

        <h1>Factors That Affect Mealworms</h1>
        <p>Mealworms are, after all, living creatures, and their importance has risen as 
            technological and environmental impacts have increased. As it has been discovered that 
            they consume polystyrene foam, understanding the factors that affect them would be highly 
            beneficial.</p><br>

                    <h5>TEMPERATURE<br>The ideal growth temperature for larvae, pupae, and adults is 25-27.5 degree celsius , which results 
                        in an 80.0-83.7-day development period (Zhao et al., 2016). </h5>

                    <h5>LIGHT<br>Due to their nocturnal behaviors, mealworms are considered as ectothermic 
                        animals that are most active at night. Since mealworms behave in this manner, it is 
                        expected that in the absence of light, their metabolic rate would be higher than in the 
                        presence of light.</h5>

                        well as competitive relationships among species. It is more prevalent in stressful 
                        situations, including when population density is high or food is low, and cannibals 
                        thus gain a nutritional advantage for this reason (Via, 1999).</h5>
