    <div class="content">
        <p>Styrofoam is a trademarked brand name referred to the application of 
            polystyrene including the utilization of expanded polystyrene (EPS) which is 
            commonly used in automobile parts, and road bank stabilization systems, food 
            containers, coffee cups, packing, and extruded polystyrene (XPS) also known as 
            blue board, often used in building insulations and water barriers (Krueger M.C. et. 
            al, 2015). Polystyrene (PS) is a petroleum-based plastic made from styrene 
            monomers. Styrene monomers are obtained by reacting ethylene with benzene in 
            the presence of aluminum chloride to yield ethylbenzene. The polymerization of 
            styrene has been known since 1839, when German pharmacist Eduard Simon 
            reported its conversion into a solid later named metastyrol (Britannica, 2018). 
            Moreover, PS is highly degradable and is resistant to photo-oxidation 
            (Bandyopadhyay and Basak, 2007). In the 1950s, synthetic plastic materials were 
            widely used commercially and economically from electronic products, drainage 
            pipelines, and containers. One of the most common single-used synthetic products 
            is Styrofoam made available and manufactured in 1947 by the Dows Chemical 
            Physics Company led by Ray McIntire (Dows Chemical Physics Lab, 1948). PS 
            products are relatively durable, light weight, good thermal insulation, high impact 
            resistance and inexpensive which is being produced several million tonnes per year 
            (Maul, J et. al, 2007).

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Decomposition of polystyrene materials</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Decomposition of polystyrene (PS) materials is extremely long since it is 
            relatively chemically inert which makes it resistant to breakdown by many acids 
            and bases, waterproof, and only disintegrates into smaller fragments due to the 
            intervention of sunlight, water, and weathering. Since PS products are composed of 
            98% air, it never loses its inherent chemical properties that makes them intact for 
            centuries. (J.A Brydson, 1999).</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Behavior of Mealworms utilizing Styrofoam as their Sole Diet
    </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>It has recently been proven that the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus 
            which are the mealworms can consume polystyrene wastes. Mealworms have 
            chewing and eating behavior for Styrofoam and other plastic foam. Being found as 
            one of the largest pests in stored-grain products, mealworms are an efficient 
            depolymerization substitute for Styrofoam or polystyrene products because of the 
            microorganisms found in their body and analyses proving that Styrofoam was 
            successfully depolymerized after being consumed by the said organisms.<br><br>
            In the experiment conducted to determine the survival rate of mealworms 
for 30 days with Styrofoam as their sole diet. After feeding the 500 mealworms of 
approximately 5.8 g of Styrofoam, the difference between the survival rate of 
Styrofoam-feeding mealworms and the survival rate of the conventional diet (bran)-
feeding mealworms was not significant with an average of 85 percent. Similar 
results were achieved using different batches of mealworms from Harbin, China 
and Compton, California, and USA. The survival rate of Styrofoam-feeding 
mealworms tested in Harbin and California were approximately 81.3 ± 2.5% and 
86.7 ± 3.3%, respectively. Hence, the consumption of Styrofoam of mealworms 
and maintaining their survival rate in optimum concludes that Styrofoam could be 
their diet for a long considerable amount of time. Furthermore, the retention time 
of ingested Styrofoam in the gut of a mealworm is estimated to be 12-15 hours. 
Styrofoam-eating mealworms can be characterized based on the changes in 
physical and chemical properties of egested residues of the mealworms deposited 
in their frass (Yang et al, 2015).<br><br>
In another experiment conducted by Wrobel, mealworms were subjected to 
biodegrade three different types of food packaging plastics: polystyrene (PS), 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polylactide (PLA). The factors to be evaluated are 
mass loss, dry matter content, and the biochemical composition of mealworms. 
Bradford method was used to determine the protein concentration in homogenates 
of the larvae while Anthrone method was utilized for the level of hydrolyzed 
carbohydrates. The experiment concluded that all three types of plastics were 
consumed by the mealworms proving that they are a key feature in degrading 
polymers in the environment (Wrobel, et. al, 2017).

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Polystyrene depolymerization by the special microbes inside a
        Mealworm's gut</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Polystyrene depolymerization and biodegradation can be characterized by 
            conducting several analyses such as Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 
            Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), solid state C-cross 
            polarization/magic angles pinning nuclear magnetic resonance (C-CP/NMR) and 
            liquid-state H nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) (Yang et. al, 2015b). By 
            conducting these analyses on the frass excreted by the mealworms after consuming 
            Styrofoam, it was significantly asserted that the residual polymer in frass decreased 
            significantly from those of the original Styrofoam material, indicating that 
            depolymerization of the PS is occurring. Furthermore, the release C-labeled CO2 
            from the mealworms confirmed the biodegradation and mineralization of 
            polystyrene (Yang et. al, 2017).<br><br>Yang et al. (2015a) devised a set-up that screens the microbes on the guts 
            of Tenebrio molitor and Zophobas morio which can digest polystyrene. By utilizing 
            a pre-sensitized plate and pre-sensitized turbidity system, Yang et. al estimated that 
            47.7% of the ingested Styrofoam carbon was converted into CO2 and the residue 
            (49.2%) was excreted in feces (frass), with a very limited fraction incorporated into 
            biomass (ca. 0.5%). In the following experiments, they proved the unique role of 
            gut bacteria in the biodegradation process. The strains collected were named TM1 
            and ZM1 using 16s rDNA sequencing. Tang et al. (2017) claimed that they isolated 
            two bacterial strains, TM1 and ZM1 (cocci-like and short rod-shaped Gramnegative bacteria) from mealworm gut, which grew in medium with PS as sole 
            carbon source. They isolated a PS-degrading bacterial strain, Exiguobacterium sp. 
            strain YT2, which was able to form a biofilm on PS and create pits and holes in the 
            plastic (Yang et al., 2015b). Furthermore, it was shown that antibiotics can suppress 
            gut microbiota and inhibit PS biodegradation indicating that PS degradation is gutmicrobe dependent (Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2018b, 2018a; Yang et al., 
            2015b).<br><br>Therefore, mealworms, and their gut bacteria, seem to be a promising ‘tool’ 
            for the degradation of PS waste. However, factors including temperature, humidity, 
            population density directly influence the development of larvae, asserting that the 
            larvae can be used as an effective technology for recycling polystyrene.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Polystyrene-Eating Mealworms as Food for Other Animals</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The future of potentially dangerous plastic additives has recently gotten a 
            lot of attention. On that account, a group of researchers in Stanford discovered that 
            mealworms could eat numerous types of plastic, particularly plastic foam, without 
            it building up in their body and still be used as a protein-rich feedstock for other 
            animals. Hexabromocyclododecane is a flame retardant found in plastic foam, this 
            component is used to enhance its manufacturing qualities while reducing 
            flammability. Mealworms excreted half of the polystyrene they ate as partly 
            decomposed pieces and the other half as carbon dioxide, implying that the 
            chemicals in the plastic end up in the environment. By 24 hours, 90% of the HBCD 
            was gone, and within 48 hours, it had completely decomposed. The worms fed a 
            constant diet of HBCD-laden polystyrene were just as healthy as the worms given 
            a normal diet after the experiment (Brandon et al., 2019).</p>
