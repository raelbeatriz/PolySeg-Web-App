        <p>A non-biodegradable material is a substance that cannot be broken down by natural 
            organisms and is thus a source of pollution or contamination. Non-biodegradable wastes, 
            unlike biodegradable wastes, are difficult to manage. Wastes that are non-biodegradable 
            cannot be decomposed or dissolved by natural agents. They will exist on earth for 
            thousands of years without deteriorating. Many plastics and Styrofoam containers made of 
            polystyrene are non-biodegradable (Mathur, 2021). Polystyrene degrades so slowly that it 
            cannot be considered as a biodegradable material. According to the Environmental Action 
            Association, most polystyrene that ends up in landfills will still be there in 500 years 
            (Korpella, 2019).
            </p>
            <p>Mealworms are the larvae of the beetle Tenebrio molitor, a darkling beetle 
                organism. Mealworms are commonly fed to reptiles and birds as a staple food. They are 
                often put out in bird feeders for wild birds, particularly during the nesting season, when 
                birds are raising their young and appreciate a ready supply of food. Also, they're sometimes 
                used as bait for fishing. Mealworm frass has a high fertilizer capacity, according to 
                chemical analysis. Frass, unlike traditional mineral fertilizer, produced small amounts of 
                micronutrients (such as Cu and Zn), which could be beneficial to crops (Houben, 2020). 
                Eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults are the four stages of development for mealworm beetles. 
                The length of time it takes for insects to progress through these stages is affected by the 
                temperature of their surroundings and the food availability (“Mealworm Beetle Life Cycle”, 
                2018). With a retention period of less than 24 hours, Styrofoam can be efficiently degraded 
                in the larval gut. Over the course of a month, larvae that are fed only with Styrofoam 
                survived just as well as those fed a regular diet or bran (Yang et al., 2015).</p>
                <p>Automating the rearing, collecting, and handling of insects is a vital step toward 
                    making insect mass production more appealing, cost-effective, and competitive. With little 
                    to no human intervention, an automated mass rearing system may promote mass organism 
                    growth from egg hatching to full adults or some stages in between, such as the larvae 
                    rearing process. Deaths and developmental disorders may be reduced by automating the 
                    rearing and transportation of these organisms. Various techniques and apparatuses are used 
                    in this automation to cause the least amount of disruption to the organisms during growth 
                    which would optimize the organisms' survival rate and health (Massaro, 2016).</p>
                    <p>The observation that mealworms can biodegrade polystyrene is now a building 
                    block toward decomposing a non-biodegradable waste into a biodegradable one. This 
                    research will be effective by using an automated technology providing a system that will 
                    continuously biodegrade Styrofoam by providing a rearing mechanism to the beetle's life 
                    cycle.</p>
